{"task_description": "navigate to the CoffeeMachine in the room and be as close as possible to it", "reasoning": "In the top-down view, according to the green arrow, I am currently facing downwards. The target CoffeeMachine highlighted with the red bounding box is in the leftside of the agent in the image, but since the agent is facing downwards, the target is actually on the right side of the agent. I can also use the information of my purple side to determine this relationship, and the red navigation line is likewise pointing toward my front left. In my first-person view, I can see the target pot marked by the red bounding box and also the red navigation arrow. To reach the target, I can choose either the action corresponding to arrow 0 or arrow 2 in the top-down view, that is, move forward or move right. Since there is an obstacle on my front, so I choose the action corresponding to arrow 2 and move rightward.", "output": "[2, 'Move rightward by 0.25']", "env_feedback": "Last action is executed successfully.", "image_path": "step1.png"}
